"Jammming" is a music app created with React that utilizes the Spotify API to search for tracks by name, artist, or album. It also allows the user to create playlists and save them to their Spotify account.

The app is a Codecademy project so credit for the idea and most of the styling goes to them. However, the code itself was written by me.

As an additional feature beyond the Codecademy instructions, my app includes a play/pause button for each track that allows users to listen to a 30 second audio preview of each track. If an audio preview is unavailable, the button is replaced with a message letting the user know that the preview is unavailable.
